# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
# Machine [CPU (CU - ALU - Registers) - Memory - I/O ]
# Operating System [Process Management - Memory Management - File System - Drivers]
# Programming Language (Abstraction)
# 	Programming Paradigm (Imperative - Do this then do that)
#		Procedural
#		Functional Programming
#		OOP - Declarative - Natural - Meta-programming
# 	Libraries

#  OOP - Basic Idea 
/*
			Software
[Computer]             [Computer]         [Computer]
	[Data,Functions]-------[
			Message		

[Object]             [Object]         [Objects]
	[Data,Methods]-------[
			Messages		
				Prof.Alan.Kay (Smalltalk) - GUI
	(1) Communication between objects (Only using Messages)
	(2) Object (Data + Methods) - Separate Data
	[	State is the evil	]

	Data   ----> (you need to protect)
	Method ----> (Your way to get the Data)

      *	Class (Definition) = Attributes - Data - Methods
	----> Many Objects
	[Class Based OOP] --- Java C# C++ Ring Ruby Python

      * Objects (Properties - Values) - Copy Object
	[Prototype Based OOP] --- Self JavaScript

      * Polymorphism ---> Same Interface (Methods) ---> For different objects 
		execute() ---> SQLite
		execute() ---> MySQL


      * Inheritance
		Child ---> Parents
					Humans
					Employee
					Engineers

     * Composition (Object - Contains other objects)
	Rectangle (2 object (Point))
