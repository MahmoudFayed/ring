/*
				Software

	[ Computer ] 		[ Computer ] 		[ Computer ]
	[Data, Functions]----> Messages

	[ Object ] 		[ Object ] 		[ Object ]
	[Attributes, Methods]----> Messages
	
	Prof. Alan Kay (SmallTalk) - GUI

	(1) - Communication Between Objects ( Only Using Messages )
	(2) - Object ( Data + Methods ) - Separate Data
		
		[  State Is The Evil  ]

	Data 	----> ( You Need To Protect )
	Methods ----> ( You Way To Get The Data )



	* Class ( Definition ) = Attributes (Data) + Methods
		---> Many Object (Instances)
		[ Class Based OOP ] ---> Java C++ C# Ring Python Ruby 
	* Object ( Properties - Values )	
		[ Prototype Based OOP ] ---> Self JavaScript
		
	* Poly - Same Interface (Methods) ---> For Different Objects
	
		execute()		---> SQLite()
		execute()		---> MYSql

	* Inheritance 
		Child ---> Parents
						Humans
						Employee
						Engineer

	* Composition (Objects - Contains Other Objects)
