# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
# Machine [ CPU (CU - ALU - Registers) - Memory -I/O ]
# Operating System [ Process Management - Memory Management - File System - Drivers ]
# Programming Language ( Abstraction )
# 	Programming Paradigm ( Imperative - Do this then Do that
#			Procedural 
# 			Functional Programming
#			OOP - Declarative - Natural - Meta-Programming )
# 	Libraries

# OOP - Basic Idea

				Prof. Alan Kay (Smalltalk) - GUI
	(1) Communication between Objects (Only using messages) (function code)
	(2) Object (Data + Methods) - Separate Data
			[State is the Evil]

	Data 	----> Daughter (you need to protect)
	Methods ----> Parents  (your way to get the Data)

	* Class (Definition) = Attributes (Data) + Methods
		----> Many Objects (Instances)
		[Class Based OOP] --- Java C# C++ Ring Ruby Python

	* Objects (Properties - Values) - Copy Object
		[Prototype Based OOP] --- Self  -JavaScript

	* Polymorphism ----> Same Interface (Methods) ---> for Different objects

		execute() 		---> SQLite
		execute() 		---> MySQL

	* Inheritance 
		Child ----> Parents 
					Humans
					Employee
					Engineers

					Animals
					Cat	Dog
	
	* Composition (Object - Contains other objects)

		Rectangle (2 Objects (Point))
